# Roadmap: CONSTRUCT

## Overview

This roadmap hardens CONSTRUCT's Claude-native foundation first, then establishes the v0.3 runtime spine, then adds bounded graph leverage and v0.4-facing contracts without pulling full browser UI work ahead of proven backend and workflow behavior.

## Milestones

- ✅ **v0.3 Claude-Native Runtime & Workflow Hardening** — Phases 1–7 (shipped 2026-06-16)
- 📋 **v0.4 UI-Primary Experience** — planned (browser-first shell on the hardened v0.3 runtime)

<summary>✅ v0.3 Claude-Native Runtime & Workflow Hardening (Phases 1–7) — SHIPPED 2026-06-16</summary>

Full phase detail (goals, success criteria, plans) archived in
[`milestones/v0.3-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v0.3-ROADMAP.md). Milestone audit:
[`milestones/v0.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`](milestones/v0.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md).

- [x] **Phase 1: Contract Canon & Artifact Governance** — canonize schemas, write gates, spec-aligned contracts (completed 2026-06-08)
- [x] **Phase 2: Governed Knowledge Operations** — reliable card/ref/connection/storage ops (completed 2026-06-10)
- [x] **Phase 3: Capability Registry, CLI & MCP Spine** — one shared runtime contract + stdio MCP server (completed 2026-06-12)
- [x] **Phase 4: Guided Workflow Operability** — state-aware help/ingestion/workflow runner + resume (completed 2026-06-10)
- [x] **Phase 5: Grounded Synthesis & Graph Reasoning** — bounded Q&A, synthesis, bridge detection (completed 2026-06-11)
- [x] **Phase 6: Derived Data, Ops UI & Governed Spikes** — view data contracts, Streamlit ops UI, governed spikes (completed 2026-06-11)
- [x] **Phase 7: Close v0.3 blockers** — RT-03 MCP schema parity, ING-02 ingest cluster validation, ING-05 graph.status wiring (completed 2026-06-16)

### 📋 v0.4 UI-Primary Experience (Planned)

Not yet scoped. Start with `/gsd:new-milestone`. Carry-over from the v0.3 audit
(see `milestones/v0.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` tech debt): RT-01/RT-02 registry
unification (eliminate views/spike/tag direct-import bypass), curation-cycle
step implementation, views.generate_data, and per-phase verification/Nyquist/
security coverage.
